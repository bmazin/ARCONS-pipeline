    """Evaluate the significance of an H score.

    The H test is an extension of the Z_m^2 or Rayleigh tests for
    uniformity on the circle. These tests estimate the Fourier coefficients
    of the distribution and compare them with the values predicted for
    a uniform distribution, but they require the user to specify the number
    of harmonics to use. The H test automatically selects the number of
    harmonics to use based on the data. 

    Arguments
    ---------

    H : float
        The H value to evaluate

    Returns
    -------

    fpp : float
        The probability of an H score this large arising from sampling a
