For the record...working with Seth here at Lick to get qt working with enthought python


Downloaded and installed this qt4 from here:
http://releases.qt-project.org/qt4/source/qt-mac-opensource-4.8.2.dmg

Then got sip from here:
http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/static/Downloads/sip4/sip-4.13.3.tar.gz

Untarred it, then did this, since the defaults seemed to make sense:

python configure.py
make
sudo make install


Now install this:
http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/static/Downloads/PyQt4/PyQt-mac-gpl-4.9.4.tar.gz

after untarring, the same thing:
python configure.py
make

but it failed......

so went back to sip and did this

python configure.py --arch i386
 folllowed by make; make install

then in PyQT
python configure.py -q /usr/bin/qmake --use-arch x86_64

but this does not work.

So now we go back to qt and get a 32 bit version of that, since I am running the 32 bit version of python from epd

http://releases.qt-project.org/qt4/source/qt-mac-opensource-4.6.4.dmg
Installed that

and it installs.  Here is the "history" trail

 668  cd ../sip-4.13.3
  669  ls
  670  make clean
  671  python configure.py -q /usr/bin/qmake --arch i386
  672  python configure.py  --arch i386
  673  make
  674  sudo make install
  675  cd ../PyQt-mac-gpl-4.9.4
  676  python configure.py -q /usr/bin/qmake --arch i386
  677  python configure.py -q /usr/bin/qmake --use-arch i386
  678  make
  679  pwd
  680  sudo make install
  681  history

BUT...this did not work, with this error:
