Modified to work with a setup.py file

This is a trivial example of how to write c code that returns a numpy
array in python.  The "ezrange" is a limited version of "arange"

The source files are ezrange.h and ezrange.c.

The innterface file is ezrange.i

The script setup.py orchestrates the build process.  For example:

$ python setup.py build

makes the files

ezrange.py and ezrange_wrap.c and also _ezrange.so in the
directory build/lib.macosx-10.7-x86_64-2.7

You need to move that file to the source directory:

$ cp build/lib.macosx-10.7-x86_64-2.7/_ezrange.so .

This is how it works:

$ python
