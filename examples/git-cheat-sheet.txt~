So you made some new files.  Here is how to share them.


1.  To add everything in the current directory:

git add .

2.  Then commit it to your "local" repository for safe keeping

git commit -a

note that this will open an editor, probably vim unless you changed a
preference.  In the editor there is a list of what files it will
commit.  Hit "i" to insert text, describe the changes, and then "esc
esc wq" to write the file and quit the editor.

3.  Synchronize with the web site.  This is where you get to see if
there are conflicts with what other people have checked in.  If there
are conflicts, then you have work to do.  Good luck.  But if you get
the message "Already up-to-date." then you are good to go.  At the
very least, there were no other changes, or if there are, then there
are no conflicts with your changes.

4.  Push the results of your work for the rest of us to see.
